# INFO 474: Interactive Info Visualization

This repository has been updated to develop and deliver Homework #4 for INTO 474 @ UW, Autumn 2025. See more details in Canvas.

This repo provides a tabbed gallery that lazy-loads p5 sketches (instance-mode) so you can organize multiple sketches in one page without them interfering.
